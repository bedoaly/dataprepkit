This project provides simple Python utilities for working with datasets using Pandas. It includes functions to automatically load files based on their type (CSV, JSON, Excel), 
perform quick analysis by displaying the number of rows and columns,
and count missing values in a specified column. The goal is to make it easy to explore and clean data with minimal code, offering a lightweight and reusable starting point for data analysis projects.
